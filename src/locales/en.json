I am a Front-end/Full-stack Developer and Web Designer since I was 16 years old. <br /> <br /> The interest in design and interfaces has always been present, resulting in a channel where I taught how to create banners, thumbnails and use features of various applications and programs. <br /> <br /> When I got to know the world of web development through a friend, right away I had the interest in the front-end part. Since then I started to study and create small projects that made me acquire more knowledge and passion for the area. <br /> <br /> Currently these are my main technologies:"
