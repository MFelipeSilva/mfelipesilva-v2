I have always had an interest in the world of technology, so much so that I already had a channel in which I taught others to create banners, thumbnails, and how to use some functionalities in some applications and programs. <br /> <br />And when I met the world of web development through a friend, I immediately had the interest in the front-end part. Since then I started to study and create small projects that made me acquire even more knowledge and passion for the area. <br /> <br /> Currently these are my main technologies:"
