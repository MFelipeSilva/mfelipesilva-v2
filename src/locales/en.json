My name is Mauricio Felipe da Silva but you can call me Felipe, I’m a Full-stack & UI/UX Design developer and I’m always looking for opportunities. <br /> <br /> I always liked the areas related to design and interfaces, so much so that I already had a channel in which I taught others to create banners, thumbnails, and how to use some functionalities in some applications and programs. <br /> <br /> And when I met the world of web development through a friend, right away I had the interest in the front-end part. Since then I started to study and create small projects that made me acquire more knowledge and passion for the area. <br /> <br /> Currently these are my main technologies:"
